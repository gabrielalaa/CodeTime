# Hello there! 
I feel like I haven't practiced in a while. I really want to maintain my programming skills and even develop them further. That's why I decided to build a habit of solving at least one problem per day. The difficulty doesn’t matter.

Even though I wish I could spend more time on this, my current focus is mainly on university and work, and I don’t really find the time to create my own real-world projects.

For now, I will complete the problems I receive from "https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/" and include my solutions here.
